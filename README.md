# Perceptron1
This perceptron could be used for many applications, however the aim of this project is described in the following lines.
This text can be found also in the first comment of the code.

	This code is a Perceptron, a type of neural network.
	Explanation of the project:

	The program does not know the mathematical functions neither the process.
	The goal for this network is to get the right value without knowing
	any of the functions. But here is the process anyways:
	I will introduce 3 random values and the addition of those three
	will be evaluated in the mathematical function 0.1x^2.
	If the value is equal or greater than 0, then that result will be used
	in the function 0.001x^3. Otherwise the  function that will be used wil be
	0.25x + 1.
	The result will be rounded up to the nearest integer if it is not a real number
	and if that result is even, the value of the output neuron will be 1, else a 0.

	In the file configuration.txt the values of the omegas and the umbral are stored.
	There is a line for each neuron, and a txt file per layer.
